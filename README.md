# NodeTraversingSimulator

This project is designed to host a very simple "World" in which a user can create, traverse, edit, and destroy different "Rooms". Each Room is a node in a much larger graph of the world. I hope to one day add enough functionality that this can become a tool that can create large and interesting worlds.
